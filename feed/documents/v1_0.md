## What's Mutant Remix?

Mutant Remix brings a new twist to the good old emojis that have become a part of our daily conversations. It includes redesigned smileys, reminiscent of the old Android blobs, while adding a bunch of new emojis, so that you can truly express yourself the way you want to.

This project is designed for use with the Revolt platform, but feel free to contribute to our repository [here](https://github.com/mutant-remix) :)

*Disclaimer: This project is not affiliated with the original Mutant Standard project.*

## What's new?

*   Our first release! <img class="emoji" src="https://static.revolt.chat/mutant/short/expressions/smileys/happy_fun/party_face.svg">
*   98 blob-ified smileys from Mutant Standard (+ some extras)
*   New website! This will be the official home for Mutant Remix from now on :)

## Are there any differences in Mutant Remix?

Our first release only features redesigned smileys from the original Mutant Standard emoji pack, but in the future we plan to fill in all the gaps to have full compatibility with Unicode (flags, missing symbols, extras, etc.)
